## Overview
This project involves the development of an embedded system using an STM32 microcontroller that performs the following key functions:
- **Temperature Monitoring:** Continuously reads ambient temperature and checks for threshold violations.
- **Fall Detection:** Detects and reports device falls using accelerometer data.
- **Alarm System:** Triggers an audible alarm when temperature thresholds are exceeded or a fall is detected.
- **Multitasking with FreeRTOS:** All functionalities are handled using real-time tasks for efficient and responsive system behavior.

The system is designed for environments where safety and monitoring are essential, such as healthcare, industrial control, and personal safety devices.

## Features
- üìâ **Fall Detection:** Detects rapid orientation changes indicating a fall.
- üå°Ô∏è **Temperature Monitoring:** Reads temperature using analog sensors via ADC.
- üö® **Alarm Trigger:** Buzzer alert system activated based on event thresholds.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Real-Time Scheduling:** FreeRTOS manages tasks like sensor reading, data processing, and alert handling.
- üß™ **Simulation Support:** Developed and tested with a C++ and OpenGL-based simulation framework.

## System Architecture
- **Microcontroller:** STM32F411
- **Sensors:** ADXL345, LM75B
- **RTOS:** FreeRTOS for task scheduling and synchronization
